**'Digital Craftsman (Developer)'**

I'm a self-taught developer on track to become full-stack and through my personal roadmap I will succeed in going further. I look forward to and strive for challenges, cooperation, and other opportunities that can lead to my growth. I plan to work with others across multiple outlets to grow my capabilities as a developer and look forward to what the future will hold!
